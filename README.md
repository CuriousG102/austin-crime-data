This application is no longer maintained. I will be replacing it very soon with austin-crime-api, a decoupled version of the stack that the Daily Texan is using to serve up its new Austin Crime interactives. IF you have an immediate interest in serving a JSON api on Austin crime data yourself, you can take a look at the coupled version of the API in my repository labeled interactives-backend. You will need a geospatial database and django to support it. The rest of the stack is flexible thanks to Django's own flexibility.
